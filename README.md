# Interactive-3D-Audio-Visualization-Tool
Developed a real-time 3D visualization in JavaScript that responds dynamically to live microphone input with the p5.js library.
Implemented FFT analysis on live audio data to extract several frequency bands (bass, mid, treble) and mapped them onto 3D objects to animate them. 
Designed noise-based visual effects and procedural textures that respond to sound intensity. 
Built features such as orbiting electron-like objects and frequency-driven spikes to create an engaging visualization reminiscent of charged particles and particle fission.
